## Introduction

Potholes are a common problem in road infrastructure, posing safety risks and increasing maintenance costs. Traditional methods rely on manual inspections, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This project leverages Faster R-CNN, a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, for efficient and accurate pothole detection from road images, making real-time detection feasible under varied environmental conditions.

## Features
- **Automated Detection**: Real-time detection of potholes from images, reducing dependency on manual inspection.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained Faster R-CNN model with precision optimized for pothole identification.
- **Diverse Environmental Conditions**: Works across varied lighting and weather conditions.
- **Potential for Smart Transportation**: Useful for integration with autonomous vehicles, drones, or road-monitoring systems.

## Dataset
A dataset of road images, annotated for potholes, was used to train and validate the model. The images include varied conditions, such as different lighting, weather, and road surfaces.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrasathThiagaraj/Pothole_detection_with_fasterRCNN_resnet50
    cd pothole-detection
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have a compatible version of PyTorch installed:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision
    ```

## Usage

1. **Training**: To train the Faster R-CNN model on your dataset, use:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --epochs 50
    ```

2. **Inference**: To run the model on new images for pothole detection:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
    ```

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, and recall on test data:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --test_dir /path/to/testset
    ```

## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% under optimal conditions, with performance varying under low-light settings. Improvements are being made to enhance robustness across all environmental conditions.

## Future Work
Future enhancements include:
- Improving detection in low-light and challenging weather conditions.
- Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., LiDAR, accelerometers) to enhance detection robustness.
- Optimizing for deployment on edge devices, such as drones and autonomous vehicles.
